component state, a validation state setter, and a set validation function\n// Component state is self-explanatory - it's a copy of the entire component state\n// The validation state setter refers to a function in the component that sets updated validation state and dispatches the set validation function as a callback\n// nestedEditFieldValidation takes updatedInstance as an additional prop - this is the state instance the user has been updating in edit mode\n\n// We set an initial validation boolean that will be switched to false if an invalid field is found\n// We also create a shallow copy of the component's validation map\n// With the nested functions, we map through the validation state and each object contained within for that component's nested state: for example, ownerContactInfo, locationContactInfo, and locationBranding\n// Both functions check if the component state has valid input, referred to by field, and whether that key/field is required - the edit variation checks the user-updated state\n// If an invalid input is found, that boolean in the validation map is set to false, along with validForm\n// The validation state setter is dispatched with the updated validation map\n// The set validation function is passed down from the container level and provides the component with the toast displaying all invalid fields\n\nexport const nestedEditFieldValidation =
